        <h2>A UNIQUE BOOK OF TRUTH</h2>
        <p id="top-text">When searching for the Bible truth, Jessica used<br>
            a similar approach to the one she uses when<br>
            researching her daughter's food allergies.<br>
            She says, "Careful reading and diligent re-<br>
            search helped me find the truth in the Bible."<br>
            Like Jessica, millions of people have learned<br>
            what the Bible says about these questions:
        </p>
        <div id="tiny-line"></div>
        <h3 style="font-family: 'SF Pro Display', serif; font-weight: normal">Why are we here? <br>
            <br>
            What happens at death?<br>
            <br>
            Why is there suffering?<br>
            <br>
            What is God doing to<br> end all suffering?<br>
            <br>
            How can we have a <br>
            happy family life?
            <br>
        </h3>
        <p id="bottom-text">You can find truthful answers to these<br>
            and other questions by reading the Bi-<br>
            ble and doing additional research online at<br>

        <h1>The issue of <br>
            The Watchtower<br>
            will examine the<br>
            following questions:<br>

        <h2>Who is God?<br>
            <br>
            Who is Jesus Christ?<br>
            <br>
            What is the <br>
            Kingdom of God?<br>
            <br>
            What does the<br>
            future hold?<br>
            <br>
        </h2>
        <p>First, though, let us begin<br>
            by considering why we can<br>
            trust the Bible as a reliable<br>
            source of truth.

    <h2 id="first-heading">CAN YOU FIND TRUTH?</h2>
    <p id="first-paragraph">You may wonder, 'How is it possible to find<br>
        out the truth about anything?' After all, find-<br>
        ing out the truth about many things seems to<br>
        be getting more and more difficult. Why?<br>
        <br>
        Many people do not trust governments,<br>
        businesses, or the media to tell them the<br>
        truth. They find it difficult to distinguish<br>
        facts from opinions, half-truths, and<br>
        outright lies that are presented as reliable in-<br>
        formation. In  this climate of distrust and<br>
        misinformation, people disagree not only on <br>
        how to interpret the facts but also on what<br>
        the actual facts are.<br>
        <br>
        Despite such challenges, it is possible to<br>
        find truthful answers to life's most important<br>
        questions. How? By applying skills you use in<br>
        everyday life.

    <h2 id="second-heading">YOUR SEARCH FOR TRUTH</h2>
    <p id="second-paragraph">To some extent, you search for the truth every<br>
        day. Consider Jessica's situation. "My<br>
        daughter's peanut allergy is so severe," she<br>
        says, "that even a trace amount of peanut<br>
